        <h1>Where immigration raids happen in London</h1>
        <h2>A deep dive into our FOI data</h2>
      </header>
    </section>
	
	<section class="content">
		<h2>The data</h2>
		<p>Home Office data has been uncovered by groups organising against immigration raids, detailing where the immigration raid hotspots are in London. This data is broken down by year, and by the first bit of the postcode (e.g. N15, E6).</p>
	</section>
	
	<section class="content_dark">
		<h2>How many raids does each area have?</h2>
		<p>Immigration raids aren't spread evenly over London. Most have had less than 100 immigration raids over the last 6 years:</p>
		<img src="..\London Raids\Outputs\Raids_totals_hist.png" />
		<p>But still, 1 in 5 London areas have had 200+ immigration raids in that time.</p>
		<img src="..\London Raids\Outputs\Raids_totals_pie.png" />
	</section>
	
	<section class="content">
		<h2>Where do lots of raids happen?</h2>
		<p>There is no single huge outlier area, with loads more raids happening there than elsewhere. In general, the more people living in an area, the more raids there are:</p>
		<img src="..\London Raids\Outputs\Raids_vs_residents.png" />
		<p>As a network of anti-raids groups, we want to know areas where there are both a high number of raids, and a high <em>rate</em> of raids -- as they could be prime areas for new anti-raids organising.</p>
		<p>In the top 20, there are areas covered by existing anti-raids groups &mdash; e.g. N15 and N17 by Haringey Anti-Raids, E15 by Newham Anti-Raids &mdash; but also lots of areas without known local organising against raids .</p>

	</section>
	
	<section class="content_dark">
		<h2>Why are there more immigration raids in some areas than others?</h2>
		<p>Given how immigration enforcement officers love their racial profiling, we looked into whether there was any link between where immigration raids happen and where communities of colour live. And sure enough, the more residents of colour in an area, the more it was targeted by immigration enforcement.</p>
		<img src="..\London Raids\Outputs\RaidsRate_vs_nonwhite.png" />
		<p>Not all migrant communities are harassed by ICE equally. In <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/Deportation2020/Table1?:language=en-GB&:embed=y&:embed_code_version=3&:loadOrderID=4&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link">other reports</a>, for example we see Indian and Pakistani migrants making up a high proportion of people deported, vs a relatively low rate of people from the Middle East. And that seems to be broadly in line with this immigration raids data too.</p>

	</section>
	
	<section class="content">
		<h2>Have raids gone up or down in the last few years?</h2>
		<p>There isn't a simple narrative like "raids have fallen over the last few years". Some areas went up, some went down, some were all over the shop.</p>
		<img src="..\London Raids\Outputs\Raids_change.png" />
		<p>More went down than up since 2014 (which admittedly is an arbitrary baseline year).</p>
